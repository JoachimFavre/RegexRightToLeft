# Regex Right To Left
## Description
Turns a regular expression into one that would work the same on a reversed string. In other words, the regex is turned to a right-to-left version of itself. This can be used to find the last (and biggest) occurrence of a regex in a string.

## Features
- Regex atoms
  - Anchors: ^, $
  - Single characters (called units in the program)
  - Escaped characters
  - Intervals
  - Groups (including group operators (see after))
- Repetition operators
  - Single characters: *, +, ?
  - Braces-repetition, such as {2,3}
  - Lazy and greedy possessive operators, such as "??" or "{2,}+"
- Group operators
  - Anonymous group: ?:
  - Positive/negative lookafter: ?= / ?!
  - Positive/negative lookbehind: ?<= / ?<!

## How to use
To only reverse a regular expression, you can call the ```deep_reverse(regex)``` function. If you need an example on how to use a reversed regular expression, you can take a look at the ```find_last(regex, string)``` function.

## Examples
This program turns:
- ```he*llo\.``` to ```\.olle*h```
- ```(?<!(micro|macro))biologist``` to ```tsigoloib(?!(orcim|orcam))```
- ```^abcd{2,}?e``` to ```ed{2,}?cba$```

## Disclaimer
This program was made in two hours, there are bugs I have no doubt about it. What I have tested seems to work, but it would be strange if there was no problem. Moreover, I have learnt regex as an autodidact, so the vocabulary I am using may not always be the right one. The probability that anyone reads those lines is very small, but still, if you see a mistake do not hesitate to point it out to me.
