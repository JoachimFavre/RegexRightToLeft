r"""
Inverses a regex expression in order to have it working for a reversed string.

Use deep_reverse(regex) to reverse a regular expression and
find_last(regex, string) to have an example of a use for reversed expressions.
Do not hesitate to use r-strings (with a r before the ": such as r".\?") so
that \ is a character in itself and is not used for escaping characters (else
you would have to write "\\\\" instead of r"\\" to have a regex of \\ which
matches \ ).
